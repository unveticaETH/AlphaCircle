# 🌀 AlphaCircle — Private Early Access 🔒

> *"Not a platform. A force multiplier for grinders."*

---

## TL;DR

**AlphaCircle** is an experimental test layer for ecosystem power users — built for those who **hunt, break, and build** early.

- 🧪 Early access to tools and coordination layers
- 🗣 Feedback loop: help shape what we build
- 🔥 Rewards? Possibly. But only if you *actually* contribute
- 🤝 Invite-only. You’re not here by accident

---

## What we’re looking for

People who:

- Drop real alpha before it hits headlines
- Actually *do* quests, not just claim them
- Know when a testnet is more than just fake money
- Care about infra and impact, not just airdrops

---

## What you’ll get

- Access to our testnet-only coordination hub
- Voting/input power on experiments
- Features built around your workflow
- Sneak peeks. Beta tools. Custom mechanics.
- Your wallet in the logs before the hype begins

---

## Why this?

We believe the best builders are often the earliest testers.  
This isn’t a community. It’s a coalition.

> If you’re here, it means someone noticed how you move.
